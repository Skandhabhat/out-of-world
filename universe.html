<p>The universe is all of space and time and their contents.It comprises all of existence, any fundamental interaction, 
    physical process and physical constant, and therefore all forms of energy and matter, and the structures they form, 
    from sub-atomic particles to entire galactic filaments. Space and time, according to the prevailing cosmological 
    theory of the Big Bang, emerged together 13.787±0.020 billion years ago,and the universe has been expanding ever 
    since. Today the universe has expanded into an age and size that is physically only in parts observable as the
     observable universe, which is approximately 93 billion light-years in diameter at the present day, while the
      spatial size, if any, of the entire universe is unknown.</p>

<p>
    Some of the earliest cosmological models of the universe were developed by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers 
    and were geocentric, placing Earth at the center.Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led
     Nicolaus Copernicus to develop the heliocentric model with the Sun at the center of the Solar System. In developing 
     the law of universal gravitation, Isaac Newton built upon Copernicus's work as well as Johannes Kepler's laws of 
     planetary motion and observations by Tycho Brahe.</p>

<p>Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Sun is one of a few hundred billion stars in the 
    Milky Way, which is one of a few hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe. Many of the stars in a galaxy
     have planets. At the largest scale, galaxies are distributed uniformly and the same in all directions, meaning 
     that the universe has neither an edge nor a center. At smaller scales, galaxies are distributed in clusters and 
     superclusters which form immense filaments and voids in space, creating a vast foam-like structure. Discoveries in
      the early 20th century have suggested that the universe had a beginning and has been expanding since then.</p>

<p>According to the Big Bang theory, the energy and matter initially present have become less dense as the universe 
    expanded. After an initial accelerated expansion called the inflationary epoch at around 10−32 seconds, and the
     separation of the four known fundamental forces, the universe gradually cooled and continued to expand, allowing 
     the first subatomic particles and simple atoms to form. Giant clouds of hydrogen and helium were gradually drawn
      to the places where matter was most dense, forming the first galaxies, stars, and everything else seen today.</p>

<p>There are many competing hypotheses about the ultimate fate of the universe and about what, if anything, 
    preceded the Big Bang, while other physicists and philosophers refuse to speculate, doubting that information 
    about prior states will ever be accessible. 
    Some physicists have suggested various multiverse hypotheses, in which the universe might be one among many.</p>

    <h1 ><center>Physical properties</center></h1>

<p>Of the four fundamental interactions, gravitation is the dominant at astronomical length scales. Gravity's effects
     are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making 
     electromagnetism relatively insignificant on astronomical length scales. The remaining two interactions, the 
     weak and strong nuclear forces, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic 
     length scales.</p>

<p>The universe appears to have much more matter than antimatter, an asymmetry possibly related to the CP violation. This 
    imbalance between matter and antimatter is partially responsible for the existence of all matter existing today,
     since matter and antimatter, if equally produced at the Big Bang, would have completely annihilated each other and 
     left only photons as a result of their interaction.[48] The universe also appears to have neither net momentum nor
      angular momentum, which absences follow[clarification needed] from accepted physical laws if the universe is
       finite.[citation needed] These laws are Gauss's law and the non-divergence of the stress–energy–momentum 
       pseudotensor.</p>
