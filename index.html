    <h1><center>MULTIVERSE</center></h1>

<p>The multiverse is the hypothetical set of all universes. Together, these universes are presumed to comprise
     everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and
      constants that describe them.</p>

<p> The different universes within the multiverse are called "parallel universes", "flat universes", "other universes",
    "alternate universes", "multiple universes", "plane universes", "parent and child universes", "many universes",
     or "many worlds". One common assumption is that the multiverse is a "patchwork quilt of separate universes all
      bound by the same laws of physics.</p>

<p>The concept of multiple universes, or a multiverse, has been discussed throughout history, including Greek philosophy.
     It has evolved and has been debated in various fields, including cosmology, physics, and philosophy. Some physicists
      argue that the multiverse is a philosophical notion rather than a scientific hypothesis, as it cannot be
       empirically falsified.
</p>

<p> In recent years, there have been proponents and skeptics of multiverse theories within the physics community. Although some
     scientists have analyzed data in search of evidence for other universes, no statistically significant evidence 
     has been found. Critics argue that the multiverse concept lacks testability and falsifiability, which are essential
      for scientific inquiry, and that it raises unresolved metaphysical issues.</p>

<p>Max Tegmark and Brian Greene have proposed different classification schemes for multiverses and universes. Tegmark's
     four-level classification consists of Level I: an extension of our universe, Level II: universes with different
      physical constants, Level III: many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, and Level IV: ultimate ensemble.
       Brian Greene's nine types of multiverses include quilted, inflationary, brane, cyclic, landscape, quantum,
        holographic, simulated, and ultimate. The ideas explore various dimensions of space, physical laws, and 
        mathematical structures to explain the existence and interactions of multiple universes. Some other multiverse
         concepts include twin-world models, cyclic theories, M-theory, and black-hole cosmology</p>


<p>The anthropic principle suggests that the existence of a multitude of universes, each with different physical laws,
     could explain the fine-tuning of our own universe for conscious life. The weak anthropic principle posits that we
      exist in one of the few universes that support life. Debates around Occam's razor and the simplicity of the 
      multiverse versus a single universe arise, with proponents like Max Tegmark arguing that the multiverse is simpler
       and more elegant. The many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics and modal realism, the belief that all
        possible worlds exist and are as real as our world, are also subjects of debate in the context of the anthropic
         principle.</p>

<h1><center>Types of multiverses</center></h1>
<p>One useful way to classify multiverse models is by the degree to which the universes proposed by the model are 
    connected—that is, by the degree to which they are part of a single system described by a well-defined physical
     and mathematical framework, generally with a common origin and possibly even interacting with one another.</p>


<p>On the fully disconnected end of this spectrum is the assertion that all possible worlds coexist with equal reality.
     This idea, known as modal realism, has been developed in philosophy, notably by the American David Kellogg Lewis 
     in the 1970s and ’80s. In physics and mathematics, meanwhile, it has been hypothesized (particularly in the 1990s
      by Swedish American physicist Max Tegmark and German computer scientist Jürgen Schmidhuber) that the known universe
       is equivalent to a mathematical formal system and that all such mathematical systems (or at least all of some
        class of such systems) are equally real. Similarly disconnected would be so-called parallel universes or other 
        spiritual or religious planes of existence. Those other universes might be believed by some people to relate to
         the observable universe or even to interact with it, but exactly how these interactions would occur is not well
          defined.</p>

<p>Somewhat more-connected multiverses could arise from processes in quantum gravity, a hypothetical theory that would 
    unite Einstein’s theory of general relativity with quantum mechanics. General relativity describes how space-time
     evolves, but it does not answer the question of how a self-contained space-time could be created or destroyed. One
      possible answer might be found in so-called cyclical cosmologies, where the “big crunch” of a collapsing universe
       would evolve into the big bang of a later expanding universe—presumably through quantum gravity or some other
        exotic process that is not described by well-understood physics. A related idea is that of the baby universe,
         in which a quantum gravitational process would create a new region of space-time that would bud off and 
         potentially disconnect from its parent universe. This would lead to a “tree” of universes unlikely to interact
          after their formation. The process has been speculated to occur in the interiors of black holes.</p>


<p>The most well-developed model of a multiverse of proliferating space-times is based on the idea of cosmological 
    inflation. Inflation is a hypothetical process of the early universe in which space-time would have expanded
     exponentially at a much faster rate than at present. In most models, expansion would have been driven by an energy
      present in the vacuum that would generate a repulsive force. This kind of exponential expansion creates a region 
      of space-time far larger than the observable universe and leads to a highly connected (albeit fairly pedestrian) 
      multiverse composed of regions very similar to the observable universe.</p>

<p>In an inflationary model, the transition to noninflation can occur at different times in different places. 
    This leads to the fascinating phenomena that, in many versions of inflation, regions always exist where the
     transition to ordinary expansion has not yet taken place and where inflation is still occurring. This possibility
      leads to yet another picture in which inflation occurs eternally and generates
     an arbitrarily large or infinite number of postinflationary regions, one of which could be the observed universe.
</p>

<p>Because the concept of inflation has both good theoretical justification and observational support and because
     the process of generating new universes through inflation is based on reasonably well-understood physics, this
      model of the multiverse has gained far more prominence than previous ideas. The inflationary multiverse is also 
      fairly connected, in that all the universes would inhabit the same space-time and interactions between neighbouring
       universes might, in principle, produce observable effects. In the most well-developed such model, the multiple
        universes are expanding bubbles in a common background; when bubbles collide, the resulting “bruise” could appear 
        as a circular disturbance on the cosmic microwave background radiation.</p>


<p>Eternal inflation has an interesting synergy with string theory. In string theory a compact space of six or more 
    dimensions is associated with each point in traditional four-dimensional space-time. (Thus, the universe actually
     has 10 or more dimensions.) The attributes of these compact spaces can determine physical conditions throughout 
     the rest of the universe. The compact space’s configuration also determines a vacuum energy, which if positive will
      generally drive eternal inflation. Moreover, transitions between configurations can occur, leading to multiple 
      universes with different physical constants and fields. This sort of multiverse has been dubbed “eternal
       inflation/string landscape.” Because physical constants would take many values in many actual universes, this 
       framework has been proposed as a so-called anthropic explanation for why certain physical constants—most notably 
       the cosmological constant—take a value compatible with a universe suited for life but very different from a 
       “natural” value. In the eternal inflation/string landscape model, much of the multiverse would be uninhabited,
        and life necessarily would be found only in a region with compatible physical constants.</p>

<p>A rather different but important type of multiverse potentially arises directly from quantum mechanics. According to
     quantum mechanics, a system can be described by states corresponding to different outcomes of a physical measurement
      of the system by a macroscopic apparatus. Before a system has been measured, it will be in a superposition of such
       states (mathematically, a sum of state vectors weighted by complex coefficients). Such a system does not admit a
        definite prediction for a measurement outcome but allows only probabilities for outcomes. An open question is how 
        these probabilities should be regarded. In particular, in an isolated system the evolution of the state vector 
        is deterministic, whereas during a measurement it appears to jump indeterministically to the state corresponding
         to the measured value. American physicist Hugh Everett proposed that this is an artifact of treating the 
         measuring apparatus classically. He proposed instead that the apparatus (and any observers) interacting with a 
         quantum system simply “enlarge” the superposition to include a superposition between macroscopic states in
          which different experimental outcomes occur. Thus, all possible outcomes occur but in different worlds. Often
           termed the “many worlds” interpretation of quantum mechanics, this sort of multiverse is very connected in 
           that it is mathematically unified. However, calculations of the decoherence between universes indicates that
            it is essentially impossible for macroscopic objects in separate universes to interact.</p>

<p>Finally, it should be noted that different types of multiverses may combine or coexist. For example, an Everett-type
     multiverse could include different worlds, each of which is a different eternally inflating multiverse, or eternal 
     inflation could, in principle, spawn multiple cyclic multiverses or result from the creation of a baby 
     universe.</p>
