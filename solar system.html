<h1><center>Solar System</center></h1>

<p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It was formed about
     4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc.
      The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core,
       releasing this energy from its outer photosphere. Astronomers classify it as a G-type main-sequence star.</p>

<p>The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets
     (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All
      terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are
       mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over 99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of the 
       remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

<p>There is a strong consensus among astronomers that the Solar System has at least nine dwarf planets: Ceres, Orcus, 
    Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake, Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna. There are a vast number of small Solar System bodies, 
    such as asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and interplanetary dust clouds. Some of these bodies are in the
     asteroid belt (between Mars's and Jupiter's orbit) and the Kuiper belt (just outside Neptune's orbit). Six planets,
      seven dwarf planets, and other bodies have orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly called 'moons'.</p>

<p>The Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's charged particles, the solar wind, forming the heliosphere. 
    Around 75–90 astronomical units from the Sun,[g] the solar wind is halted, resulting in the heliopause. This is the
     boundary of the Solar System to interstellar space. The outermost region of the Solar System is the theorized Oort
      cloud, the source for long-period comets, extending to a radius of 2,000–200,000 AU. The closest star to the Solar 
      System, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light-years (269,000 AU) away. Both stars belong to the Milky Way galaxy.</p>

<h1><center>Composition of the solar system</center></h1>

<p>Located at the centre of the solar system and influencing the motion of all the other bodies through its gravitational 
    force is the Sun, which in itself contains more than 99 percent of the mass of the system. The planets, in order of
     their distance outward from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Four
      planets—Jupiter through Neptune—have ring systems, and all but Mercury and Venus have one or more moons. Pluto had 
      been officially listed among the planets since it was discovered in 1930 orbiting beyond Neptune, but in 1992 an
    icy object was discovered still farther from the Sun than Pluto. Many other such discoveries followed, including an
     object named Eris that appears to be at least as large as Pluto. It became apparent that Pluto was simply one of the 
     larger members of this new group of objects, collectively known as the Kuiper belt. Accordingly, in August 2006 the 
     International Astronomical Union (IAU), the organization charged by the scientific community with classifying 
     astronomical objects, voted to revoke Pluto’s planetary status and place it under a new classification called dwarf 
     planet. For a discussion of that action and of the definition of planet approved by the IAU, see planet.</p>

<p>Any natural solar system object other than the Sun, a planet, a dwarf planet, or a moon is called a small body; these include asteroids, meteoroids, and comets. Most of the more than one million asteroids, or minor planets, orbit between Mars and Jupiter in a nearly flat ring called the asteroid belt. The myriad fragments of asteroids and other small pieces of solid matter (smaller than a few tens of metres across) that populate interplanetary space are often termed meteoroids to distinguish them from the larger asteroidal bodies.
</p>

<p>The solar system’s several billion comets are found mainly in two distinct reservoirs. The more-distant one, called the Oort cloud, is a spherical shell surrounding the solar system at a distance of approximately 50,000 astronomical units (AU)—more than 1,000 times the distance of Pluto’s orbit. The other reservoir, the Kuiper belt, is a thick disk-shaped zone whose main concentration extends 30–50 AU from the Sun, beyond the orbit of Neptune but including a portion of the orbit of Pluto. (One astronomical unit is the average distance from Earth to the Sun—about 150 million km [93 million miles].) Just as asteroids can be regarded as rocky debris left over from the formation of the inner planets, Pluto, its moon Charon, Eris, and the myriad other Kuiper belt objects can be seen as surviving representatives of the icy bodies that accreted to form the cores of Neptune and Uranus. As such, Pluto and Charon may also be considered to be very large comet nuclei. The Centaur objects, a population of comet nuclei having diameters as large as 200 km (125 miles), orbit the Sun between Jupiter and Neptune, probably having been gravitationally perturbed inward from the Kuiper belt. The interplanetary medium—an exceedingly tenuous plasma (ionized gas) laced with concentrations of dust particles—extends outward from the Sun to about 123 AU.</p>

<p>The solar system even contains objects from interstellar space that are just passing through. Two such interstellar objects have been observed. ‘Oumuamua had an unusual cigarlike or pancakelike shape and was possibly composed of nitrogen ice. Comet Borisov was much like the comets of the solar system but with a much higher abundance of carbon monoxide.</p>
