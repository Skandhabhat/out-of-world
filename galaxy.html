<h1><center>Galaxy</center></h1>

<p>A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.
    The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that
     contains the Solar System. Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with
      less than a thousand stars,[4] to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, 
      each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter,
      with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a
       common feature at the centres of galaxies.</p>

<p>Galaxies are categorised according to their visual morphology as elliptical,spiral, or irregular. The Milky Way is an 
    example of a spiral galaxy. It is estimated that there are between 200 billion[7] (2×1011) to 2 trillion[8] galaxies
     in the observable universe. Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000
      light years) and are separated by distances in the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison, 
      the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly)[9][a] and is separated from the Andromeda
       Galaxy, its nearest large neighbour, by just over 750,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.)</p>

<p>The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less
     than one atom per cubic metre. Most galaxies are gravitationally organised into groups, clusters and superclusters.
     The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with the Andromeda Galaxy. The group is part of
      the Virgo Supercluster. At the largest scale, these associations are generally arranged into sheets and filaments
       surrounded by immense voids. Both the Local Group and the Virgo Supercluster are contained in a much larger cosmic
        structure named Laniakea</p>

    <h1><center>types of galaxies</center></h1>
    
    <h2>Elliptical galaxies</h2>
    
    <p>These systems exhibit certain characteristic properties. They have complete rotational symmetry; i.e., they are
         figures of revolution with two equal principal axes. They have a third smaller axis that is the presumed axis
          of rotation. The surface brightness of ellipticals at optical wavelengths decreases monotonically outward 
          from a maximum value at the centre, following a common mathematical law of the form: <br>
        I = I0( r/a +1 )−2,
        where I is the intensity of the light, I0 is the central intensity, r is the radius,<br>
         and a is a scale factor. The isophotal contours exhibited by an elliptical system are similar ellipses with
          a common orientation, each centred on its nucleus. No galaxy of this type is flatter than b/a = 0.3, with 
          b and a the minor and major axes of the elliptical image, respectively. Ellipticals contain neither 
          interstellar dust nor bright stars of spectral types O and B. Many, however, contain evidence of the presence
           of low-density gas in their nuclear regions. Ellipticals are red in colour, and their spectra indicate that
            their light comes mostly from old stars, especially evolved red giants.
        Subclasses of elliptical galaxies are defined by their apparent shape, which is of course not necessarily
         their three-dimensional shape. The designation is En, where n is an integer defined by 
        n = 10( a− b)/a.
        A perfectly circular image will be an E0 galaxy, while a flatter object might be an E7 galaxy. 
        (As explained above, elliptical galaxies are never flatter than this, so there are no E8, E9, or E10 galaxies.)
        Galaxy clusters like Abell 2744 can act as a natural cosmic lens, magnifying light from more distant, background
         objects through gravity. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope may be able to detect light from the first stars in 
         the universe if they are gravitationally lensed by such clusters. (astronomy, space exploration, galaxies)
        Although the above-cited criteria are generally accepted, current high-quality measurements have shown that
         some significant deviations exist. Most elliptical galaxies do not, for instance, exactly fit the intensity law
          formulated by Hubble; deviations are evident in their innermost parts and in their faint outer parts.
           Furthermore, many elliptical galaxies have slowly varying ellipticity, with the images being more circular
            in the central regions than in the outer parts. The major axes sometimes do not line up either; their 
            position angles vary in the outer parts. Finally, astronomers have found that a few ellipticals do in fact 
            have small numbers of luminous O and B stars as well as dust lanes.</p>

<h2>Spiral galaxies</h2>

<p>Spirals are characterized by circular symmetry, a bright nucleus surrounded by a thin outer disk, and a superimposed
     spiral structure. They are divided into two parallel classes: normal spirals and barred spirals. The normal spirals
      have arms that emanate from the nucleus, while barred spirals have a bright linear feature called a bar that
       straddles the nucleus, with the arms unwinding from the ends of the bar. The nucleus of a spiral galaxy is a 
       sharp-peaked area of smooth texture, which can be quite small or, in some cases, can make up the bulk of the 
       galaxy. Both the arms and the disk of a spiral system are blue in colour, whereas its central areas are red like
        an elliptical galaxy. The normal spirals are designated S and the barred varieties SB. Each of these classes is 
        subclassified into three types according to the size of the nucleus and the degree to which the spiral arms are 
        coiled. The three types are denoted with the lowercase letters a, b, and c. There also exist galaxies that are
         intermediate between ellipticals and spirals. Such systems have the disk shape characteristic of the latter but
          no spiral arms. These intermediate forms bear the designation S0.</p>

    </center>

<h2>Irregular galaxies</h2>

<p>Most representatives of this class consist of grainy, highly irregular assemblages of luminous areas. They have
     neither noticeable symmetry nor an obvious central nucleus, and they are generally bluer in colour than are the 
     arms and disks of spiral galaxies. An extremely small number of them, however, are red and have a smooth, though
      nonsymmetrical, shape.
    galactic types
    Various galactic types. Most interesting are the numerous blue dwarf galaxies. This picture is a composite of 
    images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
    Hubble recognized these two types of irregular galaxies, Irr I and Irr II. The Irr I type is the most common of
     the irregular systems, and it seems to fall naturally on an extension of the spiral classes, beyond Sc, into
      galaxies with no discernible spiral structure. They are blue, are highly resolved, and have little or no nucleus.
       The Irr II systems are red, rare objects. They include various kinds of chaotic galaxies for which there
        apparently are many different explanations, including most commonly the results of galaxy-galaxy interactions,
         both tidal distortions and cannibalism; therefore, this category is no longer seen as a useful way to classify 
         galaxies.
    Some irregular galaxies, like spirals, are barred. They have a nearly central bar structure dominating an otherwise 
    chaotic arrangement of material. The Large Magellanic Cloud is a well-known example.</p>
